after wasting hours I've realized the the Admin-sdk can only be ran from Node js (or other backend server technologies) therefore 
this node.js file contains couple of samples to manipulate users and their claims.

Install
---------------------------------
npm install firebase-admin --save

Run
----------------------------------
# node node.js
